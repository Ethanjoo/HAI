**Thumbs Up or Down: Consumer Reactions to Decisions by Algorithms Versus Humans**
Context:

The study is situated within consumer-facing decision-making contexts across various industries, including country club memberships, bank loan applications, and research participant pool selections. It examines how consumers perceive and react to decisions made by algorithms versus humans in these specific settings.
Research Question and Findings:

Research Question: How do consumers' reactions to favorable (e.g., acceptances) versus unfavorable (e.g., rejections) decisions differ when those decisions are made by algorithms compared to humans?
Key Findings:
Consumers exhibit less positive attitudes toward a company when receiving favorable decisions made by algorithms rather than humans.
This negative reaction to algorithmic favorable decisions is not observed for unfavorable decisions; consumers' reactions are similar regardless of whether a human or algorithm made the unfavorable decision.
The underlying mechanism is based on attribution processes: favorable algorithmic decisions are harder for consumers to internalize, whereas unfavorable decisions are externalized similarly for both decision-maker types.
Theme of Research:

Human vs. AI: The research primarily explores the differences in consumer reactions to decisions made by humans compared to those made by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.
Study Method:

Empirical Study (Experimental): The research comprises ten empirical studies, including randomized controlled experiments conducted on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Prolific. These studies manipulate the type of decision-maker (algorithm vs. human) and the favorability of the decision outcome to observe the effects on consumer attitudes and behaviors.
Primary Contribution:

Theoretical Contribution: The study advances attribution theory by demonstrating how the type of decision-maker influences consumers' attributional processes based on the favorability of decisions. It bridges social psychology and marketing literature by elucidating how internal and external attributions mediate consumer reactions to algorithmic versus human decisions.
Future Research Directions and Limitations:

Future Research Directions:
Investigating consumer perceptions in humanâ€“AI collaborative decision-making environments.
Exploring the impact of specific decision criteria and contexts on the interaction between decision-maker type and decision outcome.
Examining demographic differences, such as responses from minority versus majority groups, in reactions to algorithmic decisions.
Assessing the effects of decision communication methods (e.g., person vs. nonhuman mediums) on consumer reactions.
Extending research to other behavioral measures beyond attitudes and word-of-mouth intentions.
Limitations:
The study focuses on specific industries and decision contexts, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
It primarily examines self-diagnostic decisions, leaving out other types of decision contexts that could influence attribution processes differently.

**Machines vs. Humans: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Disclosure on Customer Purchases**
Context
The study is situated within the financial services industry, specifically focusing on the use of AI-powered chatbots in outbound sales calls. It examines both the business potential and customer resistance associated with deploying chatbots for structured sales interactions.

Research Question and Findings

Research Question: How does the disclosure of an AI chatbot's identity impact customer purchase behavior during outbound sales calls?
Key Findings:
Undisclosed Chatbots: Perform on par with proficient human agents and are four times more effective than inexperienced human workers in generating customer purchases.
Disclosure Before Conversation: Significantly reduces purchase rates by over 79.7%.
Mechanisms: The negative impact of disclosure is primarily due to customers perceiving disclosed chatbots as less knowledgeable and empathetic, despite the chatbot's objective competence.
Mitigation Strategies: Delaying disclosure and leveraging customers' prior AI experience can alleviate the adverse effects on purchase rates.
Theme of Research
Human vs. AI: The study primarily focuses on comparing the performance of AI chatbots against human agents in the context of outbound sales calls, highlighting differences in effectiveness based on disclosure practices.

Study Method
Empirical Study (Field Experiment): The researchers conducted a randomized field experiment involving over 6,200 customers who were assigned to receive sales calls from either AI chatbots or human agents under six different conditions varying in disclosure timing and agent expertise.

Primary Contribution
Managerial and Theoretical:

Managerial: Provides actionable insights for businesses on how to optimize the use of AI chatbots in sales by understanding the implications of disclosure strategies.
Theoretical: Extends existing literature by offering real-world evidence on the interplay between AI technology and customer behavior, particularly regarding trust and perception issues related to chatbot disclosure.
Future Research Directions and Limitations

Limitations: The study is limited to highly structured outbound sales calls, which involve restricted two-way interactions. This setting may not capture the dynamics of more interactive or complex conversations.
Future Research Directions:
Investigate dynamic, interactive conversations between chatbots and customers.
Test the generalizability of findings in different settings, such as inbound calls.
Explore second-order effects of disclosure, including varied framing strategies that highlight technological benefits or cost savings associated with AI chatbots.
Examine customer self-selection preferences for interacting with bots versus humans based on task complexity and individual preferences.
