      "  1. Disclosing human involvement leads customers to adopt a more human-oriented communication style, characterized by longer, more complex, and more natural messages.\n",
      "  2. This change in communication style increases employee workload because fewer customer requests can be handled automatically by the chatbot and must be delegated to a human.\n",

      "The field of human versus AI decision-making has been gaining significant attention, with researchers exploring various aspects of consumer reactions and behaviors when interacting with AI systems. Two recent empirical studies have shed light on this topic, providing valuable insights into how humans perceive and respond to decisions made by AI versus humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first study, \"Thumbs Up or Down: Consumer Reactions to Decisions by Algorithms Versus Humans,\" investigates consumer reactions to decisions made by algorithms versus humans across various industries, such as country club memberships, bank loan applications, and research participant pool selections. The researchers found that consumers exhibit less positive attitudes toward a company when receiving favorable decisions made by algorithms rather than humans. This negative reaction to algorithmic favorable decisions is not observed for unfavorable decisions, as consumers' reactions are similar regardless of whether a human or algorithm made the unfavorable decision. The underlying mechanism is based on attribution processes, where favorable algorithmic decisions are harder for consumers to internalize, whereas unfavorable decisions are externalized similarly for both decision-maker types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second study, \"Machines vs. Humans: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Disclosure on Customer Purchases,\" focuses on the use of AI-powered chatbots in outbound sales calls within the financial services industry. The study reveals that undisclosed chatbots perform on par with proficient human agents and are four times more effective than inexperienced human workers in generating customer purchases. However, disclosing the chatbot's identity before the conversation significantly reduces purchase rates by over 79.7%. The negative impact of disclosure is primarily due to customers perceiving disclosed chatbots as less knowledgeable and empathetic, despite the chatbot's objective competence. The study suggests that delaying disclosure and leveraging customers' prior AI experience can alleviate the adverse effects on purchase rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both studies highlight the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and reactions when interacting with AI systems. The first study emphasizes the role of attribution processes in shaping consumer attitudes towards algorithmic decisions, while the second study underscores the impact of disclosure practices on customer purchase behavior. These findings suggest that while AI systems can be effective in certain decision-making contexts, consumer trust and perceptions play a crucial role in determining the success of AI implementations. Future research should continue to explore the nuances of human-AI interactions, focusing on factors such as decision communication methods, demographic differences, and the generalizability of findings across different settings and industries.\n",
