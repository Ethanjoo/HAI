Summary: 31**Context:**
The study is set within the healthcare sector, specifically focusing on the medical coding industry. It examines the dynamics of teaming between artificial intelligence (AI) and human workers with varying levels and types of experience.

**Research Question and Findings:**
The main research question is how different types of human work experience influence the team dynamics between AI and knowledge workers. The key findings are:
1. AI boosts productivity for all workers but more so for those with greater task-based experience.
2. Senior workers gain less from AI than their junior colleagues, due to lower trust in AI, likely triggered by their broader job responsibilities.
3. The study suggests that task experience enhances human-AI teaming, whereas seniority experience creates resistance.

**Theme of Research:**
The research falls under the theme of Human + AI collaboration.

**Study Method:**
The study is a Modeling or Model Empirical Study, as it involves the development of an AI solution for medical chart coding and a field study among knowledge workers, with detailed analysis at the medical chart level.

**Primary Contribution:**
The primary contribution is managerial, as it provides insights into how to build a more productive relationship between AI and human workers, which has important societal and business implications.

**Future Research Directions/Limitations:**
The study acknowledges limitations due to the sample being drawn from one company, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. It suggests future research directions, including examining the effect of AI in a randomized field experiment, exploring the dynamic interactions between AI and human workers, understanding how AI may transform the meaningfulness of work, and designing workflows that incorporate both human workers and AI. The study also points to the need for further investigation into mechanisms that can enhance user trust in AI, especially among senior workers.
