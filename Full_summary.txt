Summary: 11
**Context:** The study is focused on understanding the cognitive challenges in human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration, specifically in a setting where humans and AI perform classification tasks.

**Research Question and Findings:** The main research question is how humans make decisions when collaborating with AI and whether the collaboration can outperform individual performance. Key findings include:
- Humans and AI working together can outperform both when working alone.
- AI delegating work to humans improves performance, but humans delegating to AI does not.
- Humans lack metaknowledge, i.e., the ability to assess their own capabilities, leading to poor delegation decisions.
- Providing a delegation strategy or enforcing it does not significantly improve human delegation performance.

**Theme of Research:** The research falls under the theme of Human + AI collaboration.

**Study Method:** The study uses a Modeling or Model Empirical Study method, with experimental results based on behavioral experiments involving human subjects and AI algorithms.

**Primary Contribution:** The primary contribution is theoretical, as it provides insights into the cognitive challenges and limitations of human-AI collaboration, particularly regarding metaknowledge and delegation strategies.

**Future Research Directions/Limitations:** The study suggests future research directions, including:
- Investigating human-AI dialogue and decision authority.
- Exploring system feedback to increase metaknowledge.
- Researching ways to improve metaknowledge.
- Replicating studies in specialized environments and with high-impact decisions.

The study acknowledges limitations related to the use of non-specialized tasks and workers, as well as potential issues with using Mechanical Turk workers for behavioral experiments. Future research should address these limitations and explore the generalizability of the findings to other settings.
