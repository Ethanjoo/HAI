Dear Prof. Hu,
This repository contains my GPT-based agent programmed using Python. Due to the fact that I have already graduated and get limited access to publishers, I used the files you sent in the email(I also managed to download the broken one). 
Also, I mistalkenly included my less-common checked email in my CV, which resulted in my delayed access to the task. I also apologize for the inconvinence that I sent you a follow-up email yesterday. (It was after that I found the two emails already sent a few days ago.)
I understand that my mistake should not be any kind of excuse, but I need to point out that I had only less than one day in completing this task. I will really appreciate your consideration of my situation during the evaluation process.
Thank you once again for your consideration. Below are some explanations about my code.
Main file: Agent.ipynb
Supporting database: HAI_database.db. The database, created using sqlite3, stores all the summaries generated by the LLM and other relevant informations.
Original files of paper stored in the HAI folder.
The output for section 2 is printed in literature_review.txt.
