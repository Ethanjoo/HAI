Dear Prof. Hu,

This repository contains my GPT-based agent programmed using Python. Due to the fact that I have already graduated and get limited access to publishers, I used the files you sent in the email(I also managed to download the broken one). 

Thank you once again for your consideration. Below are some explanations about my code.

Main file: Agent.ipynb

Supporting database: HAI_database.db. The database, created using sqlite3, stores all the summaries generated by the LLM and other relevant informations.

Original files of paper stored in the HAI folder.

The output for section 2 is printed in literature_review.txt.
